## What we will do
We will assemble and launch a website generator that will make full-fledged pages from text documents.:

1. We will make a document, which we will then turn into a page.
2. Install the necessary software.
3. Let's install some kind of design theme to make the pages look beautiful.
4. Let's set up and run the generator.
5. Let's look at the result and think about what can be improved.
