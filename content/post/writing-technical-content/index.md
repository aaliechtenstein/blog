## What is LaTeX?

LaTEX (pronounced "latech" or "latech") is a tool for creating professional documents. It is based on the WYSIWYM editing paradigm (what I see is what I mean), that is, the user is required to focus only on the contents of the document, leaving its formatting to the program. Instead of manually distributing the text on the page, as is done in Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer, you can simply enter it, allowing LaTeX to do the rest.

## Why do I need LaTeX?

This tool is used everywhere to create scientific documents, write books, as well as many other forms of publications. It allows not only to create beautifully designed documents, but also gives users the opportunity to quickly implement such complex elements of a printed set as mathematical expressions, tables, references and bibliographies, obtaining consistent markup across all sections.

Thanks to the availability of a large number of open libraries (more on that later), the possibilities of LaTEX become almost limitless. These libraries expand the capabilities of users even more, allowing you to add footnotes, draw diagrams, etc.

One of the most compelling reasons why many people use LaTeX is to separate the content of a document from its style. This means that after writing the content, you can easily change its appearance. Similarly, you can create one document style and use it to standardize the appearance of others.
