## Application Development stages
The software development process is usually divided into the following
stages:
- planning, which includes the collection and analysis of requirements for the functionality and other characteristics of the application being developed;
- design, which includes the development of basic algorithms and specifications,
the definition of a programming language;
- direct application development:
- coding â€” in fact, the creation of the source code of the program (possible
in several versions);
- analysis of the developed code;
- build, compile and develop an executable module;
- testing and debugging, saving the changes made;
- documentation.
To create the source code of the program, the developer can use any
text editor convenient for him: vi, vim, mcedit, emacs, geany, etc.
After you finish writing the source code of the program (possibly consisting of
several files), you need to compile it and get an executable module.
