## Languages
# C/C++
These languages often occupy the tops of various ratings — they are valued for their power and speed. C was created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, C++ was developed by Bjorn Stroustrup in 1985. Today, these two languages underlie everything from OS and games to modern scientific computing and machine learning. C and C++ are well suited for demanding applications that need low-level hardware access and performance. It takes time and some effort to master these languages.

# Java
Java is a general—purpose OOP language developed in the 1990s by James Gosling at Sun (now owned by Oracle) and designed to be compiled into bytecode to run on a Java virtual machine. By 2020, these include almost all types of devices — from televisions and game consoles to servers, phones and even kitchen appliances. The language is widely used in corporations and universities, which has made it popular among both novice programmers and experienced developers.

# Julia
A modern high-level language designed for high-performance numerical processing and statistical analysis. Julia was developed in 2009 by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah and Alan Edelman. It is one of the four languages that allow achieving the performance of supercomputers at the petaflops level (along with C, C++ and Fortran). It is popular in universities, governments and financial institutions.

# Python
Python, introduced in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, was conceived as a well-readable language with OOP functions, involving the use of functional paradigms to build clean and well-organized programs. Python is supported by large platforms and is used in a variety of fields, including science, intelligent data processing, the development of artificial intelligence systems, computer graphics for feature films, cloud computing, game development and many others. Python has proven itself well and will remain one of the most sought-after tools for a long time.
