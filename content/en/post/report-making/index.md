## The purpose of the work

Here is the formulation of the purpose of the laboratory work. 
The goal statements for each laboratory work are given in
the guidelines.

The purpose of this template is to simplify the preparation of reports on
laboratory work as much as possible.  By modifying this template, students will be able
to easily prepare a report on laboratory work, as well as get acquainted
with the basic features of Markdown markup.

## Task

Here is a description of the task in accordance with the recommendations
of the methodological manual and the issued version.

## Theoretical introduction

Here the theoretical aspects related to the performance of the work are described.

For example, Table @tbl:std-dir provides a brief description of standard Unix directories.

: Description of some directories of the GNU Linux file system {#tbl:std-dir}

| Directory name | Catalog description |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/` | Root directory containing the entire file |
| `/bin `      | Basic system utilities required both in single-user mode and during normal operation for all users |
| `/etc`       | System-wide configuration files and configuration files of installed programs |
| `/home`      | Contains users' home directories, which, in turn, contain personal settings and user data |
| `/media`     | Mounting points for removable media |
| `/root`      | The home directory of the user `root`                                                                                   |
| `/tmp`       | Temporary files |
