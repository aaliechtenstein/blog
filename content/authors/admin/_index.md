My name is Alina Lichtenstein, a student of the Peoples' Friendship University. I am studying at the Faculty of Physics, Mathematics and Natural Sciences, majoring in Computer and Information Sciences. Before that, I had been studying foreign languages all my life and did not see myself in anything but linguistics. However, life is a strange thing, and now I'm in a technical specialty, let's see what happens.
